✈️ Air Cargo Database Analysis (SQL Project)

📘 Project Overview  
This project showcases the end-to-end design and analysis of an airline database system using PostgreSQL.  
It models real-world air cargo operations, covering customers, aircraft, routes, travel classes, ticket details, and passenger journeys.  
The project applies SQL techniques to manage, analyze, and optimize airline data efficiently.

🎯 Objectives  
- Design a normalized relational database for airline operations.  
- Define relationships among Customers, Routes, Aircraft, and Tickets.  
- Write and execute SQL queries for insights and business decisions.  
- Create stored procedures and functions for automation.  
- Implement indexing and performance optimization.

🧩 Database Schema  
The database consists of six main entities:  
- **Customer** – Passenger details and demographics.  
- **Aircraft** – Aircraft types, capacity, and manufacturer information.  
- **Routes** – Flight origin, destination, and travel distance.  
- **Class** – Travel classes such as Economy, Business, and Economy Plus.  
- **Ticket_Details** – Ticket booking and pricing information.  
- **Passengers_On_Flights** – Links passengers to flights and travel details.
